# DotaMemeNames
They are not memes they are a way of life
By using the custom localizations feature of dota, all abilities, items, and heros can be renamed into prime meme material


Place files in
\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\core\resource

For glorious linux users:
'~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/core/resource'



Currently best way to get abilty names is to use the ingame console
while playing as a hero dota_ability_dump_refcounts will list all ability names for current hero

dota_check_localization will highlight all missing localizations in game file
